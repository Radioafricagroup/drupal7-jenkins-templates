To use these templates on a Drupal project:

(1) Create a folder called "build" in the root directory of your drupal installation
(2) copy the "build.xml" and "build.default.properties" files into that directory
(3) Create a folder called "build/build.components" and copy the component files into that directory
(4) Copy the "build.properties" file into the root directory of your drupal installation.  Change or add the variables specific to your project
(5) Have fun!
